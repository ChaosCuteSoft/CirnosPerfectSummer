    "It wasn't easy being a maid in New York. Moka Latte really wanted to work for a maid cafe just like she saw in so many anime series."
    "These days there wasn't too many of those around."
    "She walked up the straight in her summer's maid outfit. Anywhere else this would get her a lot of notice, but in New York strange outfits are just par for the course."
    "As she approached the corner up the block she sees a very odd flyer stuck to the light post."
    "On the flyer, she could read 'Maid Wanted', in what looked to be either a red sharpie or blood. It looks pretty sketchy, but when Moka saw it, her heart lept with excitement."
    m "Finally, this could be my breakthrough chance to be a maid!"
    "Moka ripped off one of the address tabs fro the bottom and stuffed it in her purse."
