    "It isn't easy being a maid in New York. Moka Latte wants to work for a maid cafe, just like she has seen in so many anime series."
    "These days there aren't too many of these cafes around."
    "She walks up the street in her summer's maid outfit. Anywhere else this would get her a lot of notice, but in New York, strange outfits are just par for the course."
    "As she approached the corner up the block, she sees a very odd flyer stuck to the light post."
    "On the flyer, she could read 'Maid Wanted,' in what looked to be either a red sharpie or blood. It looks pretty sketchy, but when Moka saw it, her heart leaped with excitement."
    m "Finally, this could be my breakthrough chance to be a maid!"
    "Moka ripped off one of the address tabs from the bottom and stuffed it in her purse."
