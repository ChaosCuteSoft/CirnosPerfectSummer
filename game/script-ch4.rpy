    #Introductory exposition
    "Everything seemed peaceful and quiet on a typical August summer day in Central Park."
    "Kids were running around playing ball, couples laid out on blankets basking in the sun."
    "All of a sudden a loud crack can be heard"
    "The clouds in the sky start swirling together, centering around the lake. The clouds grow larger, and larger, eventually the sun being blotted out from the sky."
    "A circular rift opens up above the center of the lake. Bright light shines down then a dark shade appears in the middle, red eyeballs peering down at the people below."
    "A monstrous form descends from the center. A large black ball with red eyes decorating it."
    "A girl appears to be protruding from the large black ball. She has a scaly blue dress, one shoulder appears to be that of a red-feathered bird. The bird cawed, the sound reverberating through the city."
    "On her other shoulder was a green beetle, her arm also very bug-like. Her skin was a pale white, her short hair colored in a  light blue. Her eyes glowed red and she grinned widely."

    #Enter Cirno

    c "Ah this is just what I was looking for! A fresh city full of people to worship the strongest fairy of them all!"
    "Cirno flies around above Central Park, looking at all the people, buildings and nature below."
    "She raised her hands to the sky, the bird cawing and the beetle loudly clicking."
    "Snow starts pouring from the sky, blanketing the city in white. The lake freezes over, large spikes of protruding from the surface."
